# Memory Machine Technical Implementation Proposal

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The Memory Machine system will be implemented with a modular architecture consisting of three main components as outlined in the project overview:

1. **Library** - Document database and knowledge storage system
2. **User Interface** - Input mechanisms and query interface
3. **Researcher Agents** - Hierarchical agent system for data processing and query resolution

## 2. Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Python 3.12+
- **Database**: 
  - Vector database (Pinecone/Milvus/FAISS) for embeddings
  - Document store (MongoDB) for raw content
  - Graph database (Neo4j) for knowledge relationships
- **ML/AI**: 
  - LLMs for text understanding (OpenAI API, local Llama models)
  - Embedding models (Sentence-BERT, OpenAI embeddings)
  - Custom fine-tuned models for specific domain adaptation

### Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- FastAPI for RESTful API endpoints
- Kubernetes for orchestration (optional for larger deployments)
- Redis for caching and pub/sub messaging between agents

## 3. Component Details

### 3.1 Library Implementation

The Library will be implemented as a multi-modal storage system:

#### Document Storage Layer
- Raw document storage in MongoDB collections
- Document metadata including timestamps, sources, formats
- Version control for document updates

#### Vector Store Layer
- Embeddings for all textual content stored in vector database
- Semantic search capabilities using cosine similarity
- Clustering of related content

#### Knowledge Graph Layer
- Neo4j graph database for relationships between entities
- Ontology definitions for domain-specific knowledge
- Bidirectional links between documents and knowledge entities

#### Library API
```python
class Library:
    def store_document(document, metadata)
    def retrieve_document(document_id)
    def search_semantic(query_vector, top_k=10)
    def search_metadata(filter_params)
    def get_related_documents(document_id)
    def update_knowledge_graph(entities, relationships)
    def query_knowledge(query_graph_pattern)
```

### 3.2 User Interface

The UI will offer multiple input methods:

#### Data Input Capabilities
- Text uploads (notes, documents, emails)
- Image uploads with automatic tagging and OCR
- Audio transcription
- Structured data import (CSV, JSON)
- API integrations with common services (calendar, email, etc.)

#### Query Interface
- Natural language query system
- Context-aware conversations
- Multi-turn dialogues with the Researcher agents
- Dashboard for visualizing library contents and relationships

### 3.3 Researcher Agent System

#### Agent Hierarchy
- **Coordinator Agent**: Manages the workflow and delegates to specialized agents
- **Specialist Agents**:
  - Text Processors: Handle textual content analysis
  - Image Analyzers: Process and tag visual content
  - Metadata Extractors: Generate metadata from raw content
  - Knowledge Curators: Update and maintain the knowledge graph
  - Query Resolvers: Handle user questions and research tasks

#### Agent Communication
- Pub/sub message passing architecture using Redis
- Structured message format with task descriptions and context
- Asynchronous processing pipeline with task queue

#### Agent Capabilities
- Long and short-term memory mechanisms
- Reasoning capabilities using chain-of-thought processes
- Self-reflection and correction mechanisms
- Learning from user feedback

## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 Data Ingestion Flow
1. User uploads content through the interface
2. Coordinator Agent receives the content and creates processing tasks
3. Specialist Agents process the content (text extraction, embedding generation, entity recognition)
4. Results are stored in the Library's appropriate layers
5. Knowledge Graph is updated with new entities and relationships
6. Confirmation is sent to the User

### 4.2 Query Resolution Flow
1. User submits a question
2. Query Resolver Agent analyzes the question intent
3. Agent formulates a research plan using available Library resources
4. Multiple sub-queries may be dispatched to the Library
5. Retrieved information is synthesized into a comprehensive answer
6. Response is delivered to the User with citations
7. User feedback is collected for future improvements

## 5. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 months)

## 6. Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling of document storage through sharding
- Vector database optimization for larger collections
- Batched processing for large document ingestion
- Caching frequently accessed knowledge patterns
- Distributed agent processing for parallel tasks

## 7. Privacy and Security

- End-to-end encryption for personal data
- Access controls based on user permissions
- Local deployment options for sensitive data
- Anonymization of personal identifiers when processing
- Regular security audits and privacy reviews

## 8. Evaluation Metrics

- Query response time
- Answer relevance and accuracy
- Knowledge retention over time
- System learning curve (improvement rate)
- User satisfaction surveys

## 9. Future Extensions

- Multi-user collaboration features
- API for third-party integrations
