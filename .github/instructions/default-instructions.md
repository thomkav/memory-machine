# Copilot Edit Instructions
When prompted in Copilot Edit, no matter what code edits are code, always do these additional tasks, in this order.

1. Recreate the file, `file_architecture.md`
2. Add a log of the edit session as a sequential file in the `edit_logs` directory. The log should contain the date, time, and a brief description of the changes made. Refer to `edit_logs/example_edit_log.md` for an example.
