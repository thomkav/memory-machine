# Edit Log: Requirements Files Creation

## Changes Made

1. Created `requirements.txt` with core project dependencies inferred from the Makefile:
   - AWS SDK (boto3)
   - Database dependencies (psycopg2, SQLAlchemy, alembic)
   - Core utility libraries (pydantic, dotenv, click, requests, yaml)

2. Created `requirements-dev.txt` with development dependencies:
   - Testing tools (pytest, pytest-cov)
   - Code formatting and linting (black, isort, flake8)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Git hooks (pre-commit)

## Rationale

Based on the Makefile analysis, the project appears to be using:
- PostgreSQL database operations
- AWS services
- Unit testing framework
- Database migrations

The requirements files were created to support these functionalities while following common Python project practices.
