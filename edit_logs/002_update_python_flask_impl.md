# Edit Log: Update to Python/Flask Implementation

## Description
Updated documentation to reflect a Python/Flask implementation of Memory Machine instead of the previously implied TypeScript implementation. This included modifying code examples, API reference signatures, and adding Flask-specific information.

## Changes Made
1. Updated `file_architecture.md` to:
   - Mention Python/Flask as the implementation technology
   - Add Python-specific directory structure
   - Include files like app modules, routes, services, and configuration

2. Revised `docs/Library.md` to:
   - Replace TypeScript code examples with Python equivalents
   - Update API method signatures to follow Python conventions
   - Add a section on Flask API endpoints
   - Align documentation with Python/Flask implementation patterns

## Next Steps
- Create Flask application scaffolding based on the directory structure
- Implement the Library model and routes according to documentation
- Update Researcher documentation to also reflect Python/Flask implementation
- Consider creating API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI
