# Edit Log: Create Library Documentation

## Description
Created documentation for the Library component in `docs/Library.md`. The file follows a similar structure to the existing Researcher documentation, including overview, features, usage examples, API reference, and best practices.

## Changes Made
1. Created new file `docs/Library.md` with comprehensive documentation for the Library component
2. Updated `file_architecture.md` to include the new Library documentation file
3. Added this edit log to document the changes

## Next Steps
- Consider expanding the API reference with additional methods
- Add diagrams to illustrate the Library's architecture
- Create integration examples with other components beyond Researcher
